### An interactive map for tabletop rpgs

This is an empty map for playing tabletop RPGs. If you would like to populate it for your own use, feel free!

Add content to each hex by finding the coresponding location in the HTML that matches the hex number and populate it with as much descriptive text as you would like!

The "template" branch contains a clean slate for you to start with. Clone it if you would like to make all your own content!
